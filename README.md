### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨, ask anyone.  
<!--
**AdamUnderstand/AdamUnderstand** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I've a love for just about anything and everything related to code and software and am an avid collector of all things in the realm of exactly that, well, and just about anything else I might run across on these interwebs. If its out there, I'll **find** it, will **gaze** at it, **play** with it, **hoard** it, and then **will likey forget** about it. ***And so***, I've created this here account, as well as various others elsewhere, were I can **anon-o-share** all that '*love*' with the lot of you.

Am a sofware dev and will do so for as long as anyone will pay me to do that do, ya'know? These days I tend to be a bit of a dreamer, always wanting to give out thoguhts on how something could be changed or improved, how a UI might be tweeked or where things could be added to make a project more extensible and complete. Fairly good at finding ways to tuck away added functionality in a software without bloating a UI and complicating a UX. **Alas, no-one seems to want to pay me to do that. **Soo**, if you're in the market for an opinion, hey!, send me a link and you'll likely get one.** I do however play with my own projects, just never get around to finishing (see previous paragraph). One of these days perhaps I'll do something on my own, but for now: **Here** we are.
